This is the landing page for a series owner (using the provided access link).

A "series" is a series of weekly tennis fixtures on the same day and time of the week (the start time can adjust slightly subject to court availability).

The series owner uses this page to:
- Access a forthcoming fixture (the next fixture or the one after that)
- Add and remove the people who participate in fixtures (and who will be invited)
- Edit basic series data, such as the start time and court numbers to be used

New fixtures are automatically created to maintain two future fixtures. When a new fixture is created, it uses series data, such as the list of participants. If you make a change to series data, it will impact subsequently created fixtures.
