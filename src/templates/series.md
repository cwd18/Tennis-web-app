This is the landing page for a series owner (using the provided link).

A "series" is a series of weekly tennis fixtures on the same day and time of the week (the time can adjust slightly owing to court availability).

The series owner uses this page to:
- Edit basic series data
- Add and remove the people who participate in fixtures (and who will be invited)
- Drill down into a particular fixture
- Add the next fixture to the series

The heading shows the usual fixture day and start time, the series owner, and which courts should be booked.
